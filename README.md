Create some amazing pieces of artwork (or non-sense works of art !) using the power of Markov chains !

## How does it work ? *(updated in 21st Oct 2025)*

This project runs only in Python. \
You need at least **Python 3.12 (or more recent versions)** and the python module  **pygame 2.6.1 (or more recent versions)** to run this project. \
Type ```git clone https://github.com/HiAbdounour/Markov-Pixel-Art``` in the terminal (cmd) to download the project. \
Type ```python markov.py``` just then.

Right after that *(and some init messages)* you'll be ask to put four values for your initial color, respectively for **cyan**, **magenta**, **yellow** and **black**. (The color is coded following the [CMYK color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model). Then just watch as the window fills itself continously. \
At the end, you can take a screenshot of your fabulous artwork.

*Some examples (screenshots) will be added soon.*

Let's dive inside Markov's secrets !

## Changelog
See the changelogs [here](https://github.com/HiAbdounour/Markov-Pixel-Art/releases).\
*It is expected to create a v1 in which users can have more flexibility on color generation and Markov chains.*
